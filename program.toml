# Playbill — Video Program Definition
#
# Each [[segment]] is rendered in order and concatenated into the final video.
#
# Segment types:
#   title    — text card (white on black, fade in/out)
#   intro    — portrait video (left) + text overlay (right)
#   episode  — pass-through video file, scaled/padded to output resolution
#   scene    — pass-through video clip (same as episode, semantic distinction)
#   quote    — photo or video (left) + quote text (right)
#   credits  — scrolling photos, friend quotes, background music with ducking
#
# Optional: segments can have an `act` field (integer) to produce per-act
# output files in addition to the combined output.
#
# Output files:
#   output/playbill.mp4           — full concatenated program
#   output/act1.mp4, act2.mp4     — per-act files (if acts are defined)
#   output/playbill_preview.mp4   — preview mode (--preview)
